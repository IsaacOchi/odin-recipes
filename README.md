This project is about creating a recipe website. I will be learning how to this using HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT.
By the end of this project I should be able to;
1. Create repositories and clone them to my local machine.
2. Use HTML to put content on the website.
3. Style the content using CSS.
4. Add interactivity using JAVASCRIPT.
